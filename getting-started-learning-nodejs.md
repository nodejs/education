####Getting started learning Node.js  
In Node.js, it’s a challenge to keep learning materials up to date. There are a lot of great tutorials out there that may not be maintained for versions, so our short list here is some great ways to jump in. It is by no means the comprehensive list of ways to get started in learning Node.js!

[NodeSchool.io](http://nodeschool.io/) is an online, distributed community of Node.js folks learning and teaching one another. Take a look at https://github.com/maxogden/art-of-node alongside choosing some of these modules http://nodeschool.io/#workshoppers (a buddy to work with can be helpful here).   
  
If you’d like a refresher of JS or are new to the language, check out http://jsforcats.com/ first!

RisingStack also offers a great walkthrough. https://blog.risingstack.com/node-hero-tutorial-getting-started-with-node-js/

There are a few courses that are low cost and offer a more comprehensive getting-started experience(<$50 USD) as well:
- https://www.coursera.org/learn/server-side-development(free but can pay a little for more services such as a certificate of completion and grading)
- https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-node-js-developer-course/ $19 USD 

We can’t stress enough the power of others in helping your Node.js learning experience. Please check out our [docs](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/) and look for [your local Node.js event](https://nodejs.org/en/get-involved/events/). We’re also [on IRC](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=node.js) and happy to answer questions. Say hi!
