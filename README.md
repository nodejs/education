![welcome-taco](https://media.giphy.com/media/l2JHZ0dIcyFo5UQGQ/giphy.gif)

Here we will ask fun questions like, 'what is education in [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)?' 

Notice we didn't say 'answer'? This [repository](http://techterms.com/definition/repository) exists to explore what it means to be learning Node.js. Who uses it? How are folks learning it? How can we as a community make the experience better and inclusive for existing users and  rad, diverse group of learners? 

**Looking for a few resources on how to start learning Node.js?** [Try here.](https://github.com/nodejs/education/blob/master/getting-started-learning-nodejs.md)

A few people who are exploring this currently:

- [Tracy Hinds](https://twitter.com/HackyGoLucky), Education Community Manager for the Node.js Foundation
- Education Advisory Group for the Node.js Foundation
- Lots of awesome community folks who have been doing cool stuff for a while in Node.js and deserve to be heard, like you!

Please participate. File issues, PRs, and create the community you'd like to be a part of. If you need inspiration or have questions that you'd like to ask outside of issues, reach out to tracy.hinds@linuxfoundation.org
